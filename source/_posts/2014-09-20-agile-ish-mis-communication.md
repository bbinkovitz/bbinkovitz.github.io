Along with the marvelous [Kelsey Bentham][1], I gave a talk that was tentatively titled "[Make Project Success without A Babel Fish"][2]. I dropped the babel fish joke at the last minute because I wasn't sure how many people would get it. (Hint: It's from Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy.)

It uses concepts and language from the Agile project management methodology to describe common communication mistakes that can sink projects, give some clues about how they arise, and make some suggestions about how to avoid them. Also includes humorous examples of how things can go wrong, hopefully to help you catch it early when your project starts going off the rails. Or just to laugh at.

It's also the same talk we gave at [Twin Cities Drupal Camp][3] in August, but the Fox Valley folks were nice enough to make this great recording of us and put it on YouTube:
