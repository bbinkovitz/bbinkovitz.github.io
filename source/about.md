# Git Blame

Hi, this blog is my fault.

I'm a PHP developer at [Palantir][1]. I cut my teeth on Drupal.

I also enjoy cats, pie, sweaters, and plants.

I live in Chicago. My sweetie and I both belong to a little tuxedo cat named Wubi Ling Kenubi.

Before I lived in Chicago and belonged to a Cat, I lived in Ohio and also sometimes Germany.
