# Git Blame

Hi, this blog is my fault.

I'm a PHP developer. I cut my teeth on [Drupal][1] but I also have experience with [Wordpress][2], [Symfony 2][3] and [Silex][4], [Sculpin][5] and [Twig][6] (obvi), and some forays out of PHP and into [Ember][7], [Meteor][8], Ruby, and Python. 

Also I have a [Twitter bot][9] that I built with [Node][10] and the [Wordnik API][12]. I really love Twitter bots and I subscribe to a [bot newsletter][11].

I also enjoy cats, pie, sweaters, and plants.

I live in Chicago. My sweetie and I both belong to a little tuxedo cat named Wubi Ling Kenubi.

Before I lived in Chicago and belonged to a cat, I lived in Ohio and also sometimes Germany.
